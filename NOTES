we use admin/sites/show instead of admin/sections/index for dashboard like 
pages because it leaves more flexibility

# ISSUES

- form builder
- inherited resource controller plugin
- minimal
- i18n key conventions

- controller: responders, redirect_to/return_to/registry
- resource abstraction/reflection vs hardcoded url_helpers
