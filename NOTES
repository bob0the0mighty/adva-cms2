we use admin/sites/show instead of admin/sections/index for dashboard like 
pages because it leaves more flexibility

we should be able to use url_for and polymorphic_url because that's the abstraction
that is native to Rails. we will need the abstraction and should not implement one
ourselves


# ISSUES

- form builder
- inherited resource controller plugin
- minimal
- i18n key conventions

- controller: responders, redirect_to/return_to/registry
- resource abstraction/reflection vs hardcoded url_helpers
