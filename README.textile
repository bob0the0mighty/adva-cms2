adva-cms2 is the successor of adva-cms which was the first completely
engine-based CMS plattform for Rails. adva-cms2 is written for and
based on Rails 3.

adva-cms2 is currently in an early developer sneak-peak preview stage.

h3. Developer level feature overview

See doc/FEATURES.textile:"http://github.com/svenfuchs/adva-cms2/doc/FEATURES.textile"
for an overview.

h3. Todo

See doc/TODO:"http://github.com/svenfuchs/adva-cms2/doc/TODO" for an incomplete
todo list

h3. Running adva-cms2 tests

adva-cms2 uses cucumber, test/unit (with test_declarative), factory_girl and
mocha for testing.

Cucumber features require setting up a "dummy app" which is used as a
context for the various adva-cms2 engines to run the cucumber features in.

Thus, when you want to run the tests for the first time you have to "regenerate"
this application:

<pre>
  $ REGENERATE_APP=1 rake
</pre>

As long as you don't add any migrations you can now use this application for
subsequent test runs and just use:

<pre>
  $ rake
</pre>

h3. Generate a new adva engine

$ thor adva:generate:engine contacts

h2. Using adva-cms2

*SOME IMPORTANT NOTES:*
1. Because of some of its dependencies, adva-cms2 currently does not run on ruby 1.9.x, it only runs on ruby 1.8.7.
2. If you get errors along the lines of "super called outside of method (NoMethodError)" it's probably because you're using Ruby patch-levels 1.8.7-p248 and 1.8.7-p249. If you are on one of these patch-levels, please use rvm and update your ruby version to 1.8.7-p299 or higher.

h3. Get adva-cms

From github:

bc. $ git clone git://github.com/svenfuchs/adva-cms2
$ cd adva-cms2
$ bundle install

*Generate a new app and run it:*

Be warned: Make sure the target directory does not exist (yet) or is
disposable, it will be removed and regenerated.

bc. $ thor adva:app my_new_app --target /home/user/path/to/apps
$ cd /home/user/path/to/apps/my_new_app
$ bundle install
$ rails s

Now in your browser navigate to http://localhost:3000. Fill out the fields in the resulting page and click 'Create Site'. After this you can log in to your new site with the credentials 'admin@admin.org' and password 'admin!'.
