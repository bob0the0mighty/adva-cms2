h2. adva-cms development

h3. Running the tests

Integration tests require setting up a "host app" which is then used as a context for the various adva gems to run the cucumber features in.

So when you want to run the tests for the first time you have to "regenerate" this application:

$ REGENERATE_APP=1 rake

As long as you don't add any migrations you can now use this application for subsequent test runs and just use:

$ rake

h3. Development mode and class reloading

Views seem to be reloaded depending on their timestamp. To turn on controller/model class reloading for adva-cms Gems:

  # config/application.rb

  module TheApp
    class Application < Rails::Application
      # Enables or disables engine reloading.
      config.reload_engines = true
    end
  end

=> umm, might or might not (yet) work as expected. plz check.

h3. Generate a new adva engine
