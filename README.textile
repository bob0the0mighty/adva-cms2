h2. adva-cms development

Views seem to be reloaded depending on their timestamp. To turn on controller/model class reloading for adva-cms Gems:

  # config/application.rb

  module TheApp
    class Application < Rails::Application
      # Enables or disables engine reloading.
      config.reload_engines = true
    end
  end

=> crap. might not (yet) work as expected
