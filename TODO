* split public sections_controller (aka, implement blogs_controller etc)
* implement common static middleware for assets (see railties)
* maybe have an Adva::Railtie which serves as a base class for all of our railties 
  and adds common behaviour automatically (like looking up config/redirects.rb, 
  registering tasks etc.)
