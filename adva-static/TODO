- copying static files
  - make $ thor adva:static:export copy files from public asset dirs
  - watch public asset dirs, simply recopy everything on every change (?)
- watcher currently does not export created files because Rack::Export only exports after purging urls that have been tagged
- read an optional manifest of starting urls
