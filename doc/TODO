Done:

+ resource url and link helpers
+ improve view/form extensibility by using a base module
+ rename Section#title to Section#name
+ fix installation controller and view, add admin user, add safeguard
+ style flash
+ make cucumber support and test setup stuff more accessible to others
+ fix inherited_resources/link_to to take arguments, fix destroy links, use in menus + tables
+ add rails.css and fix delete links
+ port svenfuchs.com and add a jekyl format
+ don't use a blog layout, extend the default layout
+ core: categories
+ fix login flash css
+ fix admin backend css
+ reorganize stylesheets, there's tons of duplication and the file organization doesn't make too much sense
+ don't use multiple static middleware instances for serving static assets
+ patch action_view asset_tag_helper registration to allow appending assets to existing groups
+ improve menu item helper to use only the last part of a dot separated i18n key
+ improve menus to allow for registering and thus prepending/appending/moving items
+ i18n: clean up scopes
+ i18n: fix inherited_resources lookup scopes
+ i18n: make :'.foo' additionally lookup sane defaults (using I18n::Cascade)
+ improve polymorphic url_for patch (see adva-core/lib/patches/rails/url_for.rb)
+ add published_at column to contents
+ core: content filters
+ refactor: in section_controller merge params[:section] to params[:blog] (or whatever the concrete controller type is)

Stuff:

- static: changing the title of an imported post does not delete the record
- i18n: fix simple_form lookup scopes
- install: figure out how to generate config hooks for the app to configure adva-cms (e.g. adva-user/devise)
- refactor: figure out how to remove set_params_for_nested_resources controller filters
- cache: tagging doesn't play well with Arel scopes
- cache: tagging (or whoever) seems to use the filtered path (apparently section_root) instead of the real request path
- thor: engine migration generator
- make adva-user optional (using http_auth?), fix Site.install
- custom error pages
- add features for confirmations, passwords, unlocks to adva-user

Optimize:

- optimize routing filters
- development mode seems to load nokogiri, webrat, etc.
- further speed up Adva::Rack::Static by memoizing existing static file paths

Features:

- core: detect site from host, multiple sites
- core: excerpts (improve truncate_html)
- core: system events, orchestration (?)
- core: authorship
- core: publishing
- core: content translation
- core: content versioning
- core: list filters
- core: tags
- core: optimistic lock
- blog: rss feeds
