# routing-filter

Routing filter allows for friendly public URLs. It basically

* wraps around the Rails routing system (i.e. both URL recognition and generation) and 
* allows the application to use standard rails url helpers and routes internally but
* shows friendly, readable URLs to the user

# simple_form

A fantastic form generation helper framework by Jose Valim which makes form generation
a snap. Similar to formtastic but way more clean and straightforward.

# inherited_resources

Another gem by Jose Valim which provides controller abstraction.

# minimal

Pure Ruby object-oriented views. Nuff said.

# simple_nested_set

Simplest-thing-possible nested set functionality. I.e. less configurable than
others but more feature complete (e.g. provides automatic materialized path
updates) and easier to use.

# simple_slugs

Simplest-thing-possible slugging functionality (for permalink generation).

# simple_table

Simple table view builder.
